    1. If you worked in pairs:
        Ryan and Devin worked on the first part of the assignment while I supervised and provided hints, and then we switched for the second half. I worked on the second half while they gave ideas and helped troubleshoot.
        I gave ideas to Ryand and Devin as well as working on the second part.
        We all gathered to work together, and emailed code back and forth. It wasn't as easy at Git, but it worked.
        It made troubleshooting much easier and quicker, but it slowed progress sometimes.
    Where did you have trouble with this assignment? How did you move forward? What topics still confuse you?

 We had trouble with the math in the second part. It was a silly mistake, but it had almost all of our math wrong. When we tried to multiply we would do something like result *= number. However, result started off as 0. This would always yield a 0 for multiplication or division, and a negative number for subtration. It took us forever to work through the logic and figure that out!

    What did you learn from this assignment? (Please be specific)

 Double check your math, and watch how you instansiate variables.

    How could this assignment be improved in the future?

Allow students to use an ArrayList for the second half.
